## 1. File Summary

`style.css` provides the complete visual styling for the "Devious.work" website. It is designed to be modern, responsive, and maintainable, while creating a strong retro-tech/CRT monitor aesthetic. The stylesheet uses CSS variables for easy theme management (light/dark modes), Flexbox/Grid for layout, and keyframe animations for dynamic effects.

---

## 2. Current Features

-   **Theming**:
    -   Utilizes CSS variables (`--primary-color`, `--background-color`, etc.) for easy customization.
    -   A `[data-theme="light"]` attribute selector redefines these variables to switch from the default dark mode to a light mode.
-   **Retro CRT Effect**:
    -   `.crt-overlay` class creates a fixed-position overlay with a scanline gradient and a subtle flicker animation (`@keyframes flicker`) to simulate an old monitor.
    -   Text is given a `text-shadow` using the `--glow-color` variable to create a glowing effect.
-   **Typography**:
    -   Globally uses the 'VT323' monospace font for a consistent retro feel.
    -   Sets `letter-spacing` and `font-size` to enhance readability within the chosen aesthetic.
-   **Layout**:
    -   **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Uses flexible layouts (Flexbox/Grid) and media queries (`@media (max-width: 600px)`) to ensure the site looks good on all screen sizes.
    -   The main content is centered and constrained to a `max-width` of 900px for readability on large screens.
-   **Animations & Transitions**:
    -   **Initialization Screen**: Manages the `opacity` and `visibility` of elements during the loading sequence.
    -   **Matrix Title**: Styles the `<span>` elements generated by `main.js`, with a `.settled` class to apply the final glowing color.
    -   **Content Fade-in**: `.content-section` elements have a default `opacity: 0` and are transitioned to `opacity: 1` when a `.visible` class is added by JavaScript, creating a staggered loading effect.
-   **Component Styling**:
    -   **Buttons & Links**: Styled with a consistent border, color, and hover effect that inverts colors for clear feedback.
    -   **Navigation**: Uses Flexbox for alignment and a pseudo-element (`::before`) to create an animated underline on hover.
    -   **Portfolio Grid**: Uses CSS Grid (`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))`) to create a responsive grid that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on available space.

## 3. Key Sections & Selectors

-   `:root`: Defines the CSS variables for the default (dark) theme.
-   `[data-theme="light"]`: Defines the variables for the light theme.
-   `.crt-overlay`: The key to the site-wide CRT monitor aesthetic.
-   `#initialization-screen`: Styles the initial loading view, centering its content.
-   `#matrix-title > span`: Styles the individual characters of the animated title. The `.settled` class marks a character as fully "decoded."
-   `.content-section`: A utility class for main content blocks, defining their border, padding, and initial state for the fade-in animation.
-   `.content-section.visible`: The class that triggers the fade-in animation.
-   `@keyframes flicker`: The animation responsible for the subtle, randomized opacity change that mimics a CRT screen.

## 4. Dependencies

-   This file is loaded by `index.html`. It does not depend on other files but is designed to work in tandem with the class manipulations performed by `main.js`.

## 5. Maintainability Notes

-   **Changing Theme Colors**: To change the site's color scheme, modify the color values in the `:root` (for dark mode) and `[data-theme="light"]` (for light mode) selectors. All components use these variables, so changes will propagate globally.
-   **Adjusting Animations**: Animation timings can be adjusted in the `transition` properties of elements (e.g., `.content-section`) or in the `@keyframes` rules.
-   **Responsive Adjustments**: For further responsive tweaks, add or modify rules within the `@media (max-width: 600px)` query at the bottom of the file.
